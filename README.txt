VERSION
Version 1.0 (October 2015)


DESCRIPTION
This data originated from http://data.howardcountymd.gov/#tab2, an open source database of the GIS Division of Howard County, Maryland.    
Age Restricted Homes[data file] contains a list of all the available age-restricted home in Howard County.  These are independent-living, single family and townhouse units.  They are located in developments created specifically for county residents age 55 and older.  The dataset includes the development name, address, phone number, minimum age requirement and geometric point location.  This is the focal dataset.
Age Restricted Apartments[data file] contains a list of all the available age-restricted apartments in Howard County.  Like the dataset above, they are independent-living and located in developments created specifically for county residents age 55 and over.  The dataset includes the developemnt name, address, phone number, email address, minimum age requirement and geometric point location.
Senior Center Locations[data file] contains a list of all the senior centers in Howard County.  These centers serve the county population age 55 and over.  The data set includes the names of the centers, address, and geometric point location.
    
By combining the first two datasets we answer the question: What independent-living housing options are available to seniors in Howard County?  The new dataset Combined Datasets[data file] is now the new focal dataset.
A map of these communities in the new focal dataset would show their locations vis-a-vis the senior centers.  It could assist county personnel in making decisions on transportation services beween senior centers and senior living communities.
